# KShare
A [ShareX](https://github.com/ShareX/) clone written in Qt. Should be cross platform

**Note:** Windows users, stick to ShareX.

## Goals
* Same support for Windows, Linux and Mac (if I ever get testers)
* Screenshotting:
* 1. Fullscreen,
* 2. Area;
* Screen recording, same options as above:
* 1. WebM
* 2. GIF (nopls)
* Custom uploader support
* Default uploaders, including:
* 1. imgur
* 2. Clipboard (not an uploader)
* 3. (S)FTP
* Oh, and a good icon.

###### Started on 19th of April 2017 to bring some attention and improvement to Linux screenshotting.
