# **KShare**
## The free open source and cross platform screen sharing software

KShare is a screenshotting utility built using Qt and written in C++.
It has many features, including:
* Area capture,
* Fullscreen capture,
* Active window capture,
* Magnifier, to make those aligments,
* Drawing on screenshots (blur, shapes, text, ...),
* Recording,
* Highly customizable video codecs,
* Automatic upload/clipboard copying,
* Hotkeys,
* Color picker, and last but not least,
* Custom upload destinations

## Enough talking, show us how it looks
The main window is rather simple, with only a log, and a button in it:

The settings have quite a bit more going on:

The area selection editor is simple:

And the color picker is the simplest thing ever:

The way you select the area to record is by resizing this simple widget:

And when you start recording there is a simple preview shown:

Currently, the only good download I provide is for Arch Linux and Ubuntu 17.04
The Arch download is on the AUR as `kshare` and `kshare-git`,  
The OS X and Debian/Ubuntu builds can be found here: [CI](https://nativeci.arsenarsen.com/job/KShare%20(master\))   
There is a windows build on [AppVeyor]()

## Wait.. how do I actually use this?
